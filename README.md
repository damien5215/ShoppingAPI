This material is public and published on YouTube by "Les Jackson".

It is a 3.5 hour tutorial titled ".NET Core 3.1 MVC REST API - Full Course".

The text below is a brief description of the content.

This course shows you how to build a full REST API using .NET Core 3.1. Weâ€™ll employ MVC, REST, the Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, Entity Framework, Data Transfer Objects, (DTOs), AutoMapper to provide 6 API endpoints that will allow you to Create, Read Update and Delete resources.

Tools used = Visual Studio, SQL Server Management Studio and Postman.

The .Net Core app is version 3.0 rather than 3.1. I plan to update this in the near future.
